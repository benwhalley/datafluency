# Real world data {#real-world-data}

### In brief

> In the real world datasets are never neat and tidy, and findings rarely
> cut-and-dried. Dealing with complexity and ambiguity is part of the role of
> the scientist. In these final sessions and the assessment we apply the skills
> we have learnt to real world examples.

## Session 1: Reproducing a real paper

In this session we dissect a specific published paper, attempt to replicate the
authors findings, and reflect on the challenges of reproducing findings given
the current state of scientific publishing.


#### The assessment {.exercise}

Read the assessment. Discuss in groups what you think is necessary for each part of the assessment. What sort of work is going to be required for each part?
Make notes on any points of disagreement or different interpretations and collate these.


#### Your paper {.exercise}

Work in groups of 3 and give a short summary of each of your papers to the others in the group. If there are people in your group without their own paper, discuss the process of finding it and what worked for you.

Reflect on the process of reading statistical methods sections in detail. Is this something you do regularly? What did you take away from the experience this time?


#### Questions {.exercise}

- What are the primary research questions of the paper?

- What predictions (if any) do the authors make?

#### Manipulation and measurement {.exercise}

- What measurements does the study make to answer these questions? What instruments/scales/other outcomes are there?

- What variables are used as predictors?

- What experimental manipulations are used? How many groupings are formed by group allocations?

- Can these measurements be used directly, or do they need to be aggregated summarised or processed in some way before they are informative?

Complete the relevant columns in the xls file.


#### Statistical tests {.exercise}


- What statistical techniques does your paper use to address the primary research questions?

- Have all of the techniques been covered in PSY753? If not, make specific notes of terms you are unfamiliar with, and/or would like to learn.

- Confer with your group. Sometimes the same technique can be given different names. See if you can collaborate to work out what techniques/models are being used.

Complete the relevant columns in the xls file.



#### Graphs {.exercise}

- For each of (up to 3) question/predictions, draw out a graph, by hand, which would make it easy to *see* the answer to the question.

- Create alternative graphs of the same information which emphasise different aspects of the data, or use different visual aesthetics to make distinctions. Some points to consider when designing different graphs:

  - Is there a tradeoff between showing group differences vs. relationships vs. distributional information?
  - Is it possible to show both raw data and summaries at the same time? What are the tradeoffs involved?
  - Who is your graph for? Are you designing for other interested experts, or busy managers?

Please note for this final question you don't have to limit yourself to graphs you (personally) can actually plot. If you can describe or draw the graph we can discuss how/whether it can be made and provide support.




### For reference,

For reference, the fields in the spreadsheet are:

- First name
- Surname
- Email
- Programme
- Title of your chosen paper
- DOI or URL
- Brief summary of the paper
- Describe the primary outcome
- Was there an experimental manipulation? If so describe it briefly here.
- Describe any other predictor variables here.
- Describe/record predictions made in the introduction. Note if they are explicit or implicit.
- What statistical techniques are used in this paper? If you can describe them in terms of an `lm` model in R that is great, but don't worry if not - just describe what is done.
- Specifically, note any techniques you are not familiar with, or don't think have been covered so far in PSYC753. Include specific quotes from the methods section to illustrate.


I want everyone to have had a first-pass at completing the xls sheet before our next session.



## Session 2: Reproducing a real paper

In this session we work in groups to identify a new published paper for which we
might replicate the analysis. You will build on skills learnt in previous weeks
to wrangle the published data into a suitable format, and decide which analyses
to run.

## Session 3: Reproducing a real paper

We will finalise work on your replication, building towards the individual
assessment.

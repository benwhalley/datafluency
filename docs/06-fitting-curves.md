# Fitting curves

### In brief

> So far all our regression models have assumed that our variables have
> **_linear relationships_**. That isn't always the case, and sometimes we need
> to fit curved lines to describe the relationship of predictors and outcomes.
> As we saw before, fitting curved lines has costs as well as benefits: A curved
> line is more likely to **overfit** the data, and may be less good at
> predicting new data. But for some models curved lines are essential to
> describe the world as it really is.

## Session 1

We will cover use of polynomials and other techniques to fit curved lines with multiple regression.

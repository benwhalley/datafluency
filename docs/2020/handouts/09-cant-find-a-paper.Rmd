# An example paper

If you are wholly stuck in finding a paper, this is one example:

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0218243

[The pdf is here](data/journal.pone.0218243.pdf)

To find this, I searched on the PlosOne website for the terms: `(multiple regression OR Ancova)  AND RCT`.

I then looked for a title that seemed interesting and looked through the main paper. Specifically, I:

- Read the "Statistical analyses" section to make sure the methods were suitable
- Clicked the "Supporting information" menu to make sure data were available (they are)

I then checked the data looked ok by downloading them, using the RStudio GUI to look at the data, and also this code to check the contents of the files:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
s005 <- haven::read_spss('../data/journal.pone.0218243.s005.sav')
s006 <- haven::read_spss('../data/journal.pone.0218243.s006.sav')

s005 %>% skimr::skim()
s006 %>% skimr::skim()
```

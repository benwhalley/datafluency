# Overview

In the [lifesavR worksheets](http://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/)  we used various commands from the `tidyverse`, like `filter` and `group_by`. 

If you want to recap these commands you could use [the cheatsheet](https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/cheatR/lifesavr_cheatsheet.html), especially
the part on groups and summaries.

Today we will cover three additional techniques which are important when working with real datasets:

1. 'Pivoting' or reshaping data from long to wide formats (or the reverse)
2. Adding meaningful labels to categorical variables



# Before you start

:::{.exercise}

Make a new `rmd` file in your datafluency directory, called `data-wrangling.rmd` and record your work in this for the next 2 sessions.

# Selecting columns

The `fuel` data also contains variables for weight and power.

We can select just these columns and save them to a smaller dataframe like this:

```{r}
carperformance <- fuel %>% select(mpg, weight, power)
```

#### Explanation of the commands

- On the far left we have the name of the new variable which we will create: `carperformance`.
- We can tell this will be a new variable because the `<-` symbol is just to the right, pointing at
it.
- To see what `carperformance` contains, look to the right of the `<-`. We pipe the `fuel` data to the `select` command, which selects the`mpg`,`weight`, and`power` columns.

#### Explanation of the result

When running the command you won't see any output --- but a new object was created called `carperformance` which contained copies of the columns from `fuel` we selected.

We can see the first few rows of our new smaller dataframe like this:

```{r}
carperformance %>% head()
```



:::{.exercise}

Try selecting columns in a dataset for yourself:

- Use any of the built in dataset, creating a copy with just a subset of 3 of its columns.

# Pivoting longer {#pivotlonger}

Data is commonly stored in either
[_wide_ or _long_ format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/).

If you used SPSS to do a _t_-test or ANOVA during your undergraduate degree, you likely stored and analysed the
data in **wide** format. 

In wide format, each row represents the _observations from a single
participant_. Each measurement for a given participant are stored in separate columns. 

This is often called **row per subject** data. An example is the built in `attitude` dataset:

```{r}
attitude %>%
  head()
```

**Explanation**: Each row contains scores for a particular employee on various measures. To find out
more about these data you can type `?attitude` into the console.

---


Let's say we want a single plot of all these variables, something like this:

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
attitude %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  mutate(name=Hmisc::capitalize(as.character(name))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(name, value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x="Measure", y="Score")
```


To do this we first need to convert the data to _long_ format. In **long format**, each observation
is saved in its own row, rather than across multiple columns.

It's often called **"row per observation"** data.



### Using `pivot_longer()`



![Another term used is `melting` the data img: [TrueWarrior](https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/ppam4/ice_cream_melting_and_remelting/)](https://i.imgur.com/UBGhu.gif)


> Pivoting is where you take a long data file (lots of rows, few columns) and make it wider. Or where you take a wide data file (lots of columns, few rows) and make it longer. 


`r embed_youtube("rbuskzmCPd0")`

We can convert from wide to long using the `pivot_longer()` function, as shown in the video:

To see why the function is called 'pivot_**longer**', imagine trying to reshape just the first two rows of the attitude dataset:

```{r  echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
attitude %>%
  head(2)
```

If we use `pivot_longer` on this selection, we end up with this:

```{r message=F, warning=F}
attitude %>%
  head(2) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything())
```

**Explanation of the command**: 
- We selected a subset of columns and rows. 
- Then we used `pivot_longer(everything())` to make this into long form data.
- The `everything()` part tells R to merge values from all of the columns into a single new column called `value`, and to keep track of the original variable name in a new column called `name`)


The change works like like this:

---

You might have spotted a problem though: We don't have a record of which participant was which in the `attitude`
dataset.

This is because the mapping to participants was implicit: **each row was a different participant, but participant numbers was not actually recorded in the file**.


We can create an explicit participant identifier by adding a new column. For this we use the `mutate` and `row_number()` functions:

```{r}
attitude_with_person <- attitude %>%
  mutate(person = row_number()) %>%
  head(2)

attitude_with_person
```

Now we have a column called `person` which stores the row number.

**But** this means if we `pivot_longer()` again, we will need to tell R *which* columns
we would like to pivot. 

If we don't do this then the `person` column gets melted with everything else
so we lose track of which response belonged to which participant, like this:


```{r}
attitude_with_person %>%
  pivot_longer(everything())
```

**Explanation of the output** Because we didn't tell `pivot_longer` which columns we wanted to pivot, it put all the values into a single new column called `value`. This included our participant identifier, `person` which is not what we wanted.

-------


We can exclude `person` from the pivoting by writing:

```{r}
attitude_with_person %>%
  pivot_longer(-person) %>% 
  head()
```

**Explanation of the command and output**: 
- Here, we still use `pivot_longer` but this time we put `-person` between the parentheses. 
- The minus sign, `-`, means *don't include this variable*, so `-person` ends up meaning  *include all columns except `person`*, which is what we wanted. 
- The output now retains the `person` column, but pivots the other variables. 
- This means we can tell which person provided each datapoint.



:::{.exercise}

Use some tidyverse commands you already know (e.g. `select`), plus `pivot_longer`, to produce this plot using the `attitude` dataset:

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
attitude %>%
  select(rating, complaints, learning) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  mutate(variable=Hmisc::capitalize(as.character(name))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(variable, value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x="Measure", y="Score")
```



`r hide("Show hints")`

- Check the [cheatsheet](https://plymouthpsychology.github.io/cheatR/complete-cheat.html) if you get stuck
- You need to select only the three variables shown
- It's not necessary to create a person identifier for this plot (although it won't hurt if you do)

`r unhide()`


`r hide("Show complete answer")`

```{r}
attitude %>%
  select(rating, complaints, learning) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(name, value)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

`r unhide()`

# Pivoting to make summary tables

Imagine we want a table of the mean score for each question in the attitude dataset. 

This would be fiddly if we just tried to use `summarise` on wide format data. But if we use `pivot_longer`, `group_by` and then `summarise` (in that order) it's possible to take the data and make a table like this with 3 instructions to R:

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
attitude %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  group_by(Name=name) %>%
  summarise(Mean = mean(value), SD=sd(value))
```

:::{.exercise}


Combine the `pivot_longer`, `group_by` and `summarise` commands (in that order) to reproduce the table above.


`r hide("Show hints")`

- You want to pivot *all* of the variables in the `attitude` dataset this time
- We covered using `summarise` in the [third `lifesavR` session here](https://benwhalley.github.io/lifesavR/session-3.html#groupby). 

`r unhide()`

:::




:::{.exercise}

We might also want to produce summary statistics per-participant.

Using the commands shown above (and remembering to make 
a new column to store the participant number with `row_number()`), reproduce this table:

```{r, echo=F}
attitude %>% 
  mutate(person = row_number()) %>% 
  filter(person < 6) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-person) %>% 
  group_by(person) %>% 
  summarise(mean(value)) %>% 
  pander()
```


`r hide("Show some hints")`

To make the table you will need to use the following functions, in roughly this order:

- mutate
- filter
- pivot_longer
- group_by
- summarise
- pander

`r unhide()`



`r hide("Show the code")`

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
attitude %>% 
  mutate(person = row_number()) %>% 
  filter(person < 6) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-person) %>% 
  group_by(person) %>% 
  summarise(mean(value)) %>% 
  pander()
```


`r unhide()`

# Pivoting wider

Sometimes we have the opposite problem: We have long data, but want it in wide format. For example,
we might want a table where it's easy to compare between different years, like this:


```{r}
development %>%
  filter(year > 1990) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols=country, 
              names_from=year, 
              values_from=gdp_per_capita) %>% 
  head(3) %>% 
  pander::pander("GDP per-capita in 3 countries in 4 different years, from the development dataset.")
```


----


**Instead of making the data longer, now we want to `pivot_wider`.**


The `development` data is a fairly long format. There are multiple rows per-country
corresponding to different years.

We want to _compare_ GDP in different _years_. 

We first need to select the data we want --- `country`, `year` and `GDP`, for the years after 1990:

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
development1990s <- development %>%
  select(country, year, gdp_per_capita) %>%
  filter(year >= 1990)
```


Then we can `pivot_wider()`:

```{r}
development1990s %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year, 
    values_from = gdp_per_capita
  ) %>% 
  head()
```

**Explanation of the command and output**: 

- We started with multiple rows per country, corresponding to years. 
- We used `pivot_wider` with `names_from = year` to create new columns for each year in the data. 
- We used `values_from=gdp_per_capita` to tell `pivot_longer` to use the GDP numbers to populate the table.
- The resulting table helps us compare years within countries, or between countries, for a given year.



:::{.exercise}

Use the `funimagery` dataset in `psydata` and perform the following:

- use `select` to make a dataset with `intervention` and each of the `kg1` to `kg3` columns
- Use `pivot_longer`, `group_by` and `summarise` to calculate the average weight of participants at each timepoint
- Adapt the `group_by` function to calculate the mean at each timepoint *for each group separately*
- Add `pivot_wider` to the end of your code to create a separate column for each group. 


When you finish your data should look like this:

```{r, echo=F}
funimagery %>% 
  select(intervention, kg1, kg2, kg3) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-intervention) %>% 
  group_by(name, intervention) %>% 
  summarise(M=mean(value)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=intervention, values_from=M)
```



`r hide("Show the code")`

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
funimagery %>% 
  select(intervention, kg1, kg2, kg3) %>% 
  pivot_longer(-intervention) %>% 
  group_by(name, intervention) %>% 
  summarise(M=mean(value)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from=intervention, values_from=M)
```


`r unhide()`

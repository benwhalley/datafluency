## Adding lines

Sometimes it can be helpful to add lines to a plot: for example to show a clinically meaningful
cut-off, or the mean of a sample.

For example, let's say we want to make a scatter plot of income in the `cps2` data, but adding a
line showing the median income. First we calculate the median:

```{r}
cps2 <- read_csv("data/cps2.csv")
median_income <-  cps2 %>% summarise(median(income)) %>% pull(1)
```

**Explanation**: First, we are defining a new variable to equal the mean income in the sample. We do
this by using `summarise(mean(income))`. The part which reads `pull(1)` says "take the first
column". We need to do this because `summarise()` creates a new table, rather than a single value or
sequence of values (which we need below).

```{r}
cps2 %>%
  filter(income < 150000) %>%
  ggplot(aes(income, y=..scaled..)) +
    geom_density() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = median_income, color="red")
```

**Explanation**: We have regular density plot. This time we have added `geom_vline` which draws a
vertical line. The `xintercept` is the place on the x axis where our line should cross.

:::{.exercise}

Add a `geom_vline` to a plot you have already created. This could be either:

-   A calculated value (e.g. `mean(var)`) or
-   A fixed value (e.g. `xintercept = 20`)

## Saving plots to a file

So far we have created plots in the RStudio web interface. This is fine when working interactively,
but sometimes you will need to send a high-quality plot to someone (perhaps a journal).

The `ggsave` function lets us do this.

The first step is to make a plot, and save it (give it a name).

```{r}
myfunkyplot <- mtcars  %>% ggplot(aes(wt, mpg, color=factor(cyl))) + geom_point()
```

**Explanation**: We used the assignment operator `<-` to save our plot to a new name
(`myfunkyplot`). This means that when we run the code RStudio won't geneate any output immediately,
so we don't see the plot yet.

---

Next, we use `ggsave` to save the plot to a particular file:

```{r}
ggsave('myfunkyplot.pdf', myfunkyplot, width=8, height=4)
```

You can see the output of the `ggsave` command by downloading the file from the files directory of your RStudio window. It should end up in the same place as your R Script, provided you have created  a project (and you should always create a project).






# Scales {#ggplot-scales}

As we've already seen, plots can include multiple dimensions, and these dimensions can be displayed
using position (on the x/y axes) or colour, size etc.

`ggplot` does a good job of picking good defaults when it converts the numbers in your
dataset to positions, colours or other visual features of plots. However in some cases it is useful
to know that you can change the default scales used.

### Continuous vs. categorical scales

So far, when we have used colour to display information we have always used **categorical**
variables. This means the colour scales in our plots have looked something like this:

```{r, echo=F}
library(RColorBrewer)
display.brewer.pal(7, "Set1")
```

For example, this plot shows the relationship between life expectancy and GDP in 2002, coloured by
continent (using the `gapminder` data):

```{r}
gapminder::gapminder %>%
  filter(year==2002) %>%
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, colour=continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

However in other cases we might want to use colour to display a continuous variable. If we want to
plot continuous data in colour, we need a scale like this:

![A continuous colour scale](media/redyel.png)

In the plot below the x and y axes show the relationship between fuel economy (`mpg`) and weight (`wt`,
recorded in 1000s of lbs). Colours are used to add information about how powerful (hp, short for
horsepower) each car was:

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg, color=hp)) +
  geom_point()
```

:::{.exercise}

Did high-powered cars tend to have good or poor fuel economy?


`r hide("Show answer")`

Sadly not!

`r unhide()`

### Categorical, continuous and 'other' variables

Sometimes variables can be stored in the 'wrong' format in R.

To give one example, the `mtcars` dataset contains a column called `am`, which indicates if a car
had an automatic or manual transmission. The variable is coded as either 0 (=automatic transmission)
or 1 (=manual).

If we use the `am` variable for the colour aesthetic of a plot you will notice that `ggplot` wrongly
uses a continuous colour scale, suggesting that there are values between 0 and 1:

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg, color=am)) +
  geom_point()
```

To fix this, and draw `am` as a categorical variable, we can use the `factor` command:

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg, color=factor(am))) +
  geom_point()
```

**Explanation**: We replaced `colour=am` in the previous plot with `color=factor(am)`. The `factor`
command forces R to plot `am` as a categorical variable. This means we now see only two distinct
colours in the plot for values of 0 and 1, rather than a gradation for values between 0 and 1.

:::{.exercise}

The `mtcars` dataset contains another variable, `cyl`, which records how many cylinders each car
had.

1. Create a scatterplot of `mpg` and `wt`, with `cyl` as the colour aesthetic, treated as a
   categorical variable.

2. Repeat this, but now use `cyl` as a continuous or numeric variable.

3. Do the same again, but using a facet rather than the colour aesthetic.

:::{.exercise}

Optional: If you want to, do the section called 'Logarithmic scales' in the [extensions worksheet](02-plotting-extensions.html).

:::


### Summary of this section

-   Colour scales can be either categorical or continuous
-   Sometimes data are stored in the 'wrong' format. We can use `factor(<VAR>)` to force a variable
    to be categorical

And if you did  the extension exercises:

-   Logarithmic (log) scales create uneven spacing on the x or y axes.
-   Log scales can be useful when data have a skewed distribution, but we need to be careful when
    interpreting them.



# Comparing categories

In the examples above we have been plotting continuous variables (and adding colours etc). 

We've used density, scatter and smoothed line plots to do this.

Another common requirement is to use plots to compare summary statistics for different groups or
categories. For example, the classic plot in a psychology study looks like this:

```{r, echo=F, width=6, height=3}
set.seed(1234)
expdata <- expand.grid(Condition=LETTERS[1:3], stimuli=1:4, p=1:20) %>%
  mutate(RT = -200+rnorm(n(), 25 + 5*as.numeric(Condition=="A") + -4*as.numeric(stimuli==1), 6)^2, stimuli=factor(stimuli, labels=paste0("S", 1:4)))
write_csv(expdata, 'data/expdata.csv')
expdata <- read_csv('data/expdata.csv')
expdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(Condition, RT)) +
  stat_summary(geom='bar', fun.data=mean_se) +
  stat_summary(geom="errorbar", width=.2, fun.data=mean_se) + facet_wrap(~paste("Stimuli", stimuli))

```

However, there is evidence that readers often misinterpret bar plots. Specifically, the problem is
that we perceive values _within_ the bar area as more _likely_ than those just above, even though
this is not in fact the case.

A better choice is (almost always) to use a boxplot:

```{r}
expdata  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=stimuli, y=RT)) + geom_boxplot()
```

**Explanation**: We used `Condition`, a category, as our x axis, and reaction times as the y axis.
We added `geom_boxplot` to show a boxplot.

:::{.tip}

If you're not familiar with boxplots, there are more details in the help files (type `?geom_boxplot`
into the console) or use the [wikipedia page here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot)

:::


:::{.exercise}

Load the (simulated) dataset called `expdata.csv`.

Either download the file and upload to your Rstudio project directory, or read it directly from this url: <https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/f94baf447612e2434b181739dbba27df/raw/43df26022fff68f49918c795f27d7352dc0d3425/expdata.csv>

-   Recreate the boxplot above
-   Use a facet to recreate the plot you saw above, combining both `Condition` and `Stimuli`

:::


## Other data summary layers

If you _really_ need to plot the mean and standard error of different categories, ggplot has the
`stat_summary` command:

```{r}
expdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(Condition, RT)) + stat_summary()
```

**Explanation**: We used `Condition` and `RT` as our x and y axes, as before. This time we added
`stat_summary()` instead of `geom_boxplot()`. By default this plots the mean and standard error (a
measure of variability) in each group, using a **point-range plot**. This is better than a bar chart
because it avoids a known bias in how we read them. You can ignore the warning about
`No summary function supplied, defaulting to mean_se()` for now.

:::{.exercise}

As an extension exercise:

-   Adapt your facetted boxplot from above to show the mean and standard error instead
-   Can you combine both boxplot and summary in a single plot?

# Spit and polish

Ggplot is great because it sets sensible defaults for most things (axes, colours etc). When you are
exploring your data these defaults typically suffice. However for publication you will often need to
polish up your plots, perhaps including:

-   Label your plot axes
-   Add lines or text
-   Change plot colours etc
-   Saving to a pdf or other output format


## Labelling axes

By default, ggplot uses variable names and the values in your data to label plots. Sometimes these
are abbreviations, or otherwise need changing.

To relabel axes we simply add `+ xlab("TEXT")` or `+ ylab("TEXT")` to an existing plot:

```{r}
mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(wt, mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Weight (1000s of lbs)") +
  ylab("Fuel economy (miles per gallon)")
```

:::{.exercise}

Try adding axis labels to one of your existing plots.

:::



## Changing the label of color/shape guidelines


When adding the colour aesthetic, ggplot uses the variable name to label the plot legend. For
example:

```{r fig.width=3, fig.height=2}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg, colour=factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point()
```

The generated legend label sometimes looks ugly (like above) but this is easy to fix:

```{r fig.width=3, fig.height=2}
mtcars %>%
  ggplot(aes(wt, mpg, colour=factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(color="Cylinders")
```

**Explanation**: We added `labs(color="Cylinders")` to the plot to change the legend label.

:::{.exercise}

Try relabelling the colour legend of one of your existing plots.

# Facets

As we add layers our plots become more complex. We run into trade-offs between information density
and clarity.

To give one example, this plot shows life expectancies for each country in the development data,
plotted by year:
  
```{r}
development %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, group=country)) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
```

**Explanation**: This is another x/y plot. However this time we have not added points, but rather
smoothed lines (one for each country).

**Explanation of the code**:We have created an x/y plot as before, but this time we only added
`geom_smooth` (and not `geom_point`), so we can't see the individual datapoints. We have also added
the text `group=country` which means we see one line per-country in the dataset. Finally, we also
added `se=FALSE`. This hides the shaded area which `geom_smooth` adds by default.

**Comment on the result**: It's pretty hard to read!
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
To increase the information density, and explore patterns within the data, we might add another
dimension and aesthetic. The next plot colours the lines by continent:
  
```{r}
development %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, colour=continent, group=country)) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
```

However, even with colours added it's still a bit of a mess. We can't see the differences between
continents easily. 

To clean things up we can use a technique called **facetting**.
  
```{r fig.height=3}
development %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, group=country)) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  facet_grid(~continent)
```

**Explanation**: We added the code `+ facet_grid(.~continent)` to our previous plot, and removed the color aesthetic. This made `ggplot` create individual *panels* for each continent.
Splitting the graph this way makes it somewhat easier to compare the differences *between*
continents.

### Try facetting yourself

Use the `iris` dataset, which is built into R.

```{r, echo=F}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point()  +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~Species)
```

1.  Try to recreate this plot by adapting the code shown above

2.  Create a second plot which uses colours to distinguish species and does not use Facets

3.  In this example, which plot do you prefer? What influences when facets are more useful the just
using colour?
  



`r hide("Show code")`

1.

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)) +
  geom_point()  +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~Species)
```



2. 

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, color=Species)) +
  geom_point()  +
  geom_smooth() 
```

`r unhide()`



`r hide("Show discussion/answer")`

There's no single right answer here, but for this example I prefer the coloured plot to the faceted one.
The reason is that there are only 3 species in this dataset, and the points for each don't overlap
much. This means it is easy to distinguish them, even in the combined plot. 

However, if there were *many* different species it might be helpful to use facets instead.

Our decisions should be driven by what we are trying to communicate with the plot. What was the
research question that motivated us to draw it?
  
`r unhide()`

### Adjusting the facets

In the explanation above, we saw this plot:
  
```{r}
development %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, life_expectancy, group=country)) +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
  facet_grid(~continent)
```



Re-run the plot and make the following adaptations:
  
1.  Try replacing `facet_grid(~continent)` with `facet_grid(continent~.)`. What happens?
  
2.  Try replacing `facet_grid` with
`facet_wrap(~continent)`. What happens?
  
3.  If you have time, to see more faceting examples, see [the `ggplot` cookbook documentation](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Facets_(ggplot2)/). 
Try to re-create some of these examples.

# Comparing categories

In the examples above we have been plotting continuous variables (and adding colours etc). We've
used density, scatter and smoothed line plots to do this.

Another common requirement is to use plots to compare summary statistics for different groups or
categories. For example, the classic plot in a psychology study looks like this:

```{r, echo=F, width=6, height=3}
set.seed(1234)
expdata <- expand.grid(Condition=LETTERS[1:3], stimuli=1:4, p=1:20) %>%
  mutate(RT = -200+rnorm(n(), 25 + 5*as.numeric(Condition=="A") + -4*as.numeric(stimuli==1), 6)^2, stimuli=factor(stimuli, labels=paste0("S", 1:4)))
write_csv(expdata, 'data/expdata.csv')
expdata <- read_csv('data/expdata.csv')

expdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(Condition, RT)) +
  stat_summary(geom='bar', fun.data=mean_se) +
  stat_summary(geom="errorbar", width=.2, fun.data=mean_se) + 
  facet_wrap(~paste("Stimuli", stimuli))
```

However, there is evidence that readers often misinterpret bar plots. Specifically, the problem is
that we perceive values _within_ the bar area as more _likely_ than those just above, even though
this is not in fact the case.

A better choice is (almost always) to use a boxplot:

```{r}
expdata  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=stimuli, y=RT)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

**Explanation**: We used `Condition`, a category, as our x axis, and reaction times as the y axis.
We added `geom_boxplot` to show a boxplot.

:::{.tip}

If you're not familiar with boxplots, there are more details in the help files (type `?geom_boxplot`
into the console) or use the [wikipedia page here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot)

### Loading data over the internet

So far we have always used data from the `psydata` package. However, we can also
load data from files or over the internet using the `read_csv()` function. This is an example:

```{r}
expdata <- read_csv('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/f94baf447612e2434b181739dbba27df/raw/43df26022fff68f49918c795f27d7352dc0d3425/expdata.csv')

expdata %>% glimpse
```

***Explanation***: The part which starts `expdata <- read_csv('https://...` loads a CSV (data)
file over the internet, and stores it in the variable called `expdata`. You can click [this link](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/f94baf447612e2434b181739dbba27df/raw/43df26022fff68f49918c795f27d7352dc0d3425/expdata.csv) to see the raw data. We then use `glimpse` to 
check the data


:::{.exercise}

Load the (simulated) dataset from this url: [https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/f94baf447612e2434b181739dbba27df/raw/43df26022fff68f49918c795f27d7352dc0d3425/expdata.csv](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/f94baf447612e2434b181739dbba27df/raw/43df26022fff68f49918c795f27d7352dc0d3425/expdata.csv) (note that this URL is very long — make sure you copy the whole of it).


-   Recreate the boxplot above
-   Use a facet to recreate the plot you saw above, combining both `Condition` and `Stimuli`


`r hide('Show the desired plot')`

```{r, echo=F}
expdata  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=stimuli, y=RT)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~Condition)
```

`r unhide()`




`r hide('Show the code')`


```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
expdata  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=stimuli, y=RT)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~Condition)
```

`r unhide()`


:::



## Other data summaries

If you _really_ need to plot the mean and standard error or standard deviations of 
different categories, ggplot also has the `stat_summary` command:

```{r}
expdata %>%
  ggplot(aes(Condition, RT)) + 
  stat_summary()
```

**Explanation**: We used `Condition` and `RT` as our x and y axes, as before. This time we added
`stat_summary()` instead of `geom_boxplot()`. By default this plots the mean and standard error (a
measure of variability) in each group, using a **point-range plot**. This is better than a bar chart
because it avoids a known bias in how we read them. You can ignore the warning about
`No summary function supplied, defaulting to mean_se()` for now.


:::{.exercise}

-   Adapt your facetted boxplot from above to show the mean and standard error instead


`r hide('Show the desired plots')`


```{r, echo=F}
expdata  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=stimuli, y=RT)) + 
  stat_summary() +
  facet_wrap(~Condition)
```



`r unhide()`




`r hide('Show the code')`


```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
expdata  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=stimuli, y=RT)) + 
  stat_summary() +
  facet_wrap(~Condition)
```



`r unhide()`


:::



## Multiple summary layers

A ["violin plot"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot) is a cross between a boxplot and a density plot.

They are simple ot make in `ggplot`; we can simply replace `geom_boxplot()` with `geom_violin()`:

```{r}
expdata  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=stimuli, y=RT)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  facet_wrap(~Condition)
```


However many authors find it helpful to *overlay* additional summaries like the mean and standard error
of a variable. For example:

```{r, echo=F}
expdata  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=stimuli, y=RT)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  stat_summary() +
  facet_wrap(~Condition)
```

:::{.exercise}

Make a new plot, based on the code above, which combines `geom_violin()` with 
`stat_summary()`


`r hide("Show code")`

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
expdata  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=stimuli, y=RT)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  stat_summary() +
  facet_wrap(~Condition)
```

`r unhide()`

## Decisions about grouping

Consider the following two plots. Both present the same data on the incomes of men and 
women who are either blind or normally sighted:

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5, echo=F}
earnings$blind <- recode(earnings$blind, !!!c("yes"="Blind", "no"="Normally sighted"))


A <- earnings  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=gender, y=income/1000)) + 
  facet_wrap(~blind) + 
  stat_summary() + ggtitle("Figure A")+
  labs(y = "Income (£ 1000)", x="Gender")

B <- earnings  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=blind, y=income/1000)) + 
  facet_wrap(~gender) + 
  stat_summary() + ggtitle("Figure B") + 
  labs(y = "Income (£ 1000)", x="Vision")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(A, B, nrow=1)

```



:::{.exercise}


1. Which plot do you prefer, and why?


`r hide("Show discussion")`

I don't have a strong overall preference between the plots, but I think plot A is probabably
more useful. My reasoning is that in this plot we can see that:

1. Men are paid more 
2. Blind people are paid less
3. The gender-pay gap appears to be larger for blind people

I think that third point is slightly harder to read/understand from plot B.

*The idea to take-away is that grouping the data in the plot in different ways can make it easier or more difficult to identify different patterns.*

1. Re-organize the plot below to make it easier to see which level of education 
has the highest gender pay gap.

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5}
earnings  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=education, y=income/1000)) + 
  facet_grid(~gender) + 
  stat_summary() +
  labs(y = "Income (£ 1000)", x="Gender")
```
`r hide('Show hint')`

To reorganise the panels, you will need to amend the variables used to facet the plot.

`r unhide()`


`r hide('Show answer')`

```{r, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5}
earnings  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=gender, y=income/1000)) + 
  facet_grid(~education) + 
  stat_summary() +
  labs(y = "Income (£ 1000)", x="Gender")
```

`r unhide()`



2. Try adding `scale_y_log10()` to your updated plot. How does this change the impression you have of the data?
Which plot is the most "truthful"?



`r hide('Show answer')`

By adding a log scale to the gender pay gaps appear to be more equal across different education
categories.


```{r}
earnings  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=gender, y=income/1000)) + 
  facet_grid(~education) + 
  stat_summary() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(y = "Income (£ 1000)", x="Gender")
```

`r unhide()`



`r hide('Show discussion')`

Either plot can be considered more or less 'truthful', depending on your perspective:

- If you believe a £2000 pay gap is the same for people earning around £20,000 as it is for those earning £100,000 then the first plot is more helpful. We can see there that largest pay gaps are among the most educated and so highest-earning.

- If we consider that £2000 means less to those earning very high incomes, then the second plot is more helpful. This plot shows that, relative to total income, the size of the pay gap is pretty consistent across education categories.


However the elephant in the room is that income has a very skewed distribution:

```{r}
earnings %>% 
  ggplot(aes(income)) + geom_density()
```

This means that medians for men/women are very different to the means, and 
the median gender pay gap is different to the mean gender pay gap:

```{r}
earnings  %>%
  group_by(blind, gender) %>% 
  summarise(m=mean(income)) %>% 
  group_by(blind) %>% 
  summarise(diff(m)) %>% 
  set_names(c("Vision", "Mean pay gap (£)")) %>% 
  pander::pander()

earnings  %>%
  group_by(blind, gender) %>% 
  summarise(m=median(income)) %>% 
  group_by(blind) %>% 
  summarise(diff(m)) %>% 
  set_names(c("Vision", "Median pay gap (£)")) %>% 
  pander::pander()
```


The moral here is that different summaries of the data tell different
stories: We should explore our data thoroughly, and avoid jumping to conclusions!

### Scenario 1: Secret agent

![](images/bond-q.png){width=50%}

You are an MI6 agent, and have been sent a mystery dataset by one of your spies. She said it contains
highly important information which will be of great interest to your superiors. 

1. Use your ggplot wizardry (and techniques we have covered today) to recover this classified information 
and present it in a single graphic for Q.

---

You can load the data using a new command, `read_csv()`. This command accepts either the name
of a file, or a URL that the data is stored on the web.

The file URL is: [https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/2103941f0c2ac0449247f59fe9c976b6/raw/4630367728610f0a9937d71eeac6fb511065ee46/mystery.csv](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/2103941f0c2ac0449247f59fe9c976b6/raw/4630367728610f0a9937d71eeac6fb511065ee46/mystery.csv)

To load the data, you might write:

```{r}
mystery <- read_csv('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/2103941f0c2ac0449247f59fe9c976b6/raw/4630367728610f0a9937d71eeac6fb511065ee46/mystery.csv')

mystery %>% glimpse
```




```{r, include=F, echo=F}

mystery <- read_csv('https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/2103941f0c2ac0449247f59fe9c976b6/raw/4630367728610f0a9937d71eeac6fb511065ee46/mystery.csv')

mystery  %>%  ggplot(aes(x, y )) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~category)

```

### Scenario 2: Admissions tutor

In the 1970s the University of California, Berkley, was concerned about the fairness of their
admissions procedures. They collected data from across the university for a number of years,
recording the:

-   Number of applicants
-   The department the student applied to
-   The students' gender
-   Number of students accepted
-   The percentage students of each gender who were accepted in each department

A summary of these data are available at this link: [Berkley applications data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/datafluency/master/website/data/berkley.csv)

Your job is to:

-   Describe the pattern of applications
-   Decide if the university was fair in it's admissions procedures
-   Prepare a short presentation for the university governors which includes plots

Techniques/commands you might want to use:

-   `filter`
-   `group_by` and `summarise`
-   `stat_summary` 
-   `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`


`r hide('Show how to load the data')`


```{r}
berkley <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benwhalley/datafluency/master/website/data/berkley.csv')
berkley %>% glimpse
```

`r unhide()`




```{r, include=F, echo=F, eval=F}
# don't re-run... probs added to this file by hand
# expand.grid(gender=c("Male", "Female"), department=LETTERS[1:6]) %>% mutate(p.admitted=NA, n.applicants=NA) %>% write_csv('data/berkley-setup.csv')

b <- read_csv("data/berkley-setup.csv")
set.seed(1234)
berkley <-  b %>% expand(year = 1976:1981, gender, department) %>%
  left_join(., b) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(
    n.applicants = n.applicants + rpois(n(), round(n.applicants*.3)),
    n.admitted = round(n.applicants * (p.admitted + runif(n(), -.1, .1))),
    percent.admitted = round(n.admitted / n.applicants * 100, 2)
  ) %>%
  select(-p.admitted)

berkley %>% write_csv('data/berkley.csv')
berkley <- read_csv('data/berkley.csv')
```



`r hide("Show some examples of plots that would help us decide")`


This plot suggests a paradox: Although more men applied and were admitted, the proportion of
male applicants who were successful was actually lower than for women:

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=2, fig.width=5}
A <- berkley %>%
  ggplot(aes(gender, n.applicants)) +
  stat_summary() + ggtitle("A")

B <- berkley %>%
  ggplot(aes(gender, n.admitted)) +
  stat_summary() + ggtitle("B")


C <- berkley %>%
  ggplot(aes(gender, percent.admitted)) +
  stat_summary() + ggtitle("C")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(A, B, C, nrow=1)
```


Breaking the data down by-department reveals what is happening:


```{r, include=T, echo=F, fig.height=2, fig.width=5}
berkley %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(n.admitted, percent.admitted)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gender, value, color=name, group=name)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se) +
  stat_summary(geom="line", fun.data=mean_se) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  facet_grid(~department) + labs(x="", y="N")
```


Note that you don't (yet) know how to produce the plot above.
We will cover this in the next sessions, but for now you could
make two individual plots, like so:



```{r, include=T, echo=F}
C <- berkley %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gender, n.admitted, group=1)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se) +
  stat_summary(geom="line", fun.data=mean_se) +
  facet_grid(~department)  + ggtitle("C")
D <- berkley %>% 
  ggplot(aes(gender, percent.admitted, group=1)) +
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se) +
  stat_summary(geom="line", fun.data=mean_se) +
  facet_grid(~department)  + ggtitle("D")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(C,D, nrow=2)
```

### In brief

> Visualising data is a core skill for all quantitative researchers, and is one
> of the most transferable skills taught on the course. Although sometimes
> underplayed, visualisation plays a **_much_** more important role in good
> science than, for example, statistical testing. Effective visualisations help
> scientists understand their data, spot errors, and build appropriate models.

## Session 1

We will use R to plot linear relationships and group differences, and to include
more than 2 dimensions in a single plot using colour or shape. Along the way we
learn additional techniques to transform data to enhance our plots.

<!--
## Learning outcomes

At the end of the session you should be able to:

1. Use graphical tools in R to visualise linear relationships and group
   differences.

2. Explore visualisation strategies for situations where linear relationships
   and group differences occur together in the same dataset (e.g. grouping with
   color).

3. Transform data, creating new columns using logical operators and string
   comparison.

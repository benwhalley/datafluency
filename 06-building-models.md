# Building models

### In brief

> Models need to be _appropriately complex_. That is, we want to make models
> that represent our theories for the underlying causes of our data. Often this
> means adding many variables to a regression model or Anova. But we won't
> always be sure which variables to add. Adding multiple variables also brings
> challenges. Where predictors are correlated (termed **multicollinearity** then
> model results can be confusing. Where we would like to choose between
> alternative models then Bayes Factors can be useful.

## Session 1: Multiple regression

In this section we cover variable selection in multiple regression, and issues
in fitting linear models, including multicollinearity.

## Session 2: Anova and Bayes Factor

In this session we discuss model selection in the context of Anova and the use
of Bayes Factors to choose between theoretically interesting models.

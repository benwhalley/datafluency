# Overview


\noindent From the module aims:

> The module aims to foster fluency and confidence in the handling,
> visualisation and communication of quantitative data, alongside skills and
> techniques for working with larger corpuses of textual and other data. Data
> visualisation is taught as a foundational technique for exploring and
> communicating insights from quantitative data. Existing knowledge of linear
> models is extended with the introduction of the generalised linear model, and
> a contemporary approach, emphasising prediction and model evaluation is
> introduced.

\noindent In a nutshell: we want to give you the skills to analyse your data as independent
researchers, and to give you confidence in working with data which will stand
you in good stead in your future careers.

# Approach

Psychology students often learn statistics through a "bag of tricks"
approach. Workshops might teach how to "do an Anova", or "how run a multiple
regression". Or you might be given a checklist of things to do when analysing
data of a particular type, but without any bigger picture of what we are
trying to achieve when we collect and analyse data.

To provide a common thread to our teaching, research methods modules at Plymouth
adopt the model for the work of data scientists proposed by
[Wickham, 2017](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) (see figure):

![Wickham's model of a data science workflow](media/data-science.png)

In this module we do cover specific skills, but these are embedded within a broader approach to working with data, and integrate it into your own research.

# Format of the sessions

We have 16 sessions, which work as follows:

-   We avoid extended lectures. This doesn't work well with this subject matter.
-   The focus is on learning by doing (this is more like cooking than chemisty).
-   In the first hour of each session we will (often) work together.
-   In the second hour your work will be self-paced, or in pairs or small
    groups.
-   Activities in the workshops are variable in length, sometimes you will
    finish early, other times you may be expected to complete the activities
    outside of class.


In this course we'll learn R as we go, building a little at a time. If some of this is familiar, there will be extension exercises to enhance
your knowledge.

## The most important thing of all

The most important thing of all is to **practice**.

These materials provide lots of practice tasks. You **NEED** to work through them
all to be able to pass the course effectively.



# Lab diary/R project archive

It's recommended that you keep a running note of all the work you do in class.
This can take for form of a notebook in Word, a blog, or an R script (see first
session).

Without a running record of what you have/haven't done it's much harder for
teaching staff to help you. The record also allows us to review your progress
and make suggestions/improvements.

# Access to R

Throughout the module we use R for data processing and analysis.

If you are taking this course at Plymouth University, the easiest way to run the
code examples here is to the school's RStudio Server.

-   [Login to your account on the server here](https://rstudio.plymouth.ac.uk)
-   To get an account on the server, or reset a password,
    [contact the Psychology technical office](http://www.psy.plymouth.ac.uk/home/)

# Assessments



The assessment for PSYC753 includes 3 components:

-   A pass fail assessment which will ensure you have acquired the core skills
    in handling and visualising data.
-   A structured data analysis and visualisation task, requiring short answers
    (50%)
-   An authentic analysis assignment, where you will replicate the analysis of a
    published study (50%).

**_For submission dates please check the DLE._** Don't rely on this website.

## Core skills test

Details of the core skills test will be released in week 13 via the DLE, and
will be due around week 20 (early December).

## Analysis and visualisation task

Details of this task will be released in week 25 via the DLE (early January) and
coursework will be due around week 31 (mid February).

## Authentic analysis assessment

This task will be due around week 40.

---

Find an empirical paper for which the authors have freely-shared the dataset but
not their analysis scripts. Ideally this will link to your research interests,
or be similar to your project analysis, but this is not required.

-   A good way of finding a suitable paper would be to look through a journal
    known for publishing papers with open-source datasets, for example PlosOne.
    Another would be to search Zenodo or a similar repository for
    recently-published datasets, and look for where the articles reporting thse
    data were published.

-   To keep the assignment simple, choose a paper which uses statistical methods
    taught as part of the module, or which can be approximated by them. For
    example: a multiple regression, between-subjects Anova, or repeated measures
    Anova or mixed model.

-   Some papers report many studies, or many different analyses, and may have
    technical details with which you are not familiar. If this is the case then
    you do NOT need to deal with the whole paper: Simply **focus on one of the
    primary analyses**. For example, if one of the main study hypotheses can be
    answered by a 2x2 Anova or mixed model, but there are lots of other analyses
    included in the paper, then focus on just this one analysis.

**If you are unsure about the scope of this assignment (e.g. don't know how much
of a paper to try and replicate) then please check with the module leader early
in the process.**

Your task is to:

1. Imagine you were the author of the paper, just prior to collecting data for
   this study. Complete the form on 'aspredicted.org'. You don't actually need
   to use the aspredicted website for this â€” simply copy the heading structure
   from the form, and include your answers in your submitted manuscript. Comment
   on whether it is possible and/or straightforward to reconstruct what would
   have been in the pre-registration from what is written in the journal
   article.

2. Using `ggplot`, make at least one plot of the data which illustrate the main
   findings. Explain your design decisions for these plots: what features of the
   data were you trying to highlight, and how?

3. Replicate the statistical analysis using methods which are appropriate to the
   data. You do not need to use the _exact_ method used in the original paper:
   For example, it's fine to use a mixed model in place of a repeated-measures
   Anova. Report your findings in APA format. Compare/contrast your results with
   the published manuscript.

4. Document your responses and version of the analysis in an Rmd file with
   accompanying dataset, suitable for upload to Zenodo or OSF.io.

5. Reflect on the extent to which the concept of 'reseacher degrees of freedom'
   should influence our understanding of your chosen study.

Important notes:

-   Don't assume that a published dataset and manuscript can be easily
    replicated simply because they have been shared: **_It may well be the case
    that it is hard to replicate the findings and this is OK (and interesting!)
    You will not lose marks simply because you cannot replicate the published
    findings._**

-   You do not need to use the _exact_ method used in the original paper; the
    point of the exercise is to apply methods we have learned in an appropriate
    way.

-   Your mark will be based on how appropriate the analysis you propose is, and
    the range of skill and understanding you demonstrate in answering the
    questions.

### Submitting your answers

You should submit exactly 5 files:

1. An Rmd file and
2. datafile which when 'knitted' produce
3. An HTML or PDF document.
4. As a separate document, upload a copy of the standard CW coversheet (and
   complete the feedback section).
5. Also include a pdf copy of the study you chose to replicate.

Within the Rmd file you should:

-   Label each question clearly
-   Where necessary, include comments explaining what specific lines of code do.
-   Intersperse explanatory text with code chunks (don't put everything in the
    same code chunk).

Your Rmd file should "Just Work" when the marker opens and runs it, and produce
the same output as the knitted HTML or PDF file you submitted (i.e. there won't
be any errors or missing datafiles).

If you work on your own computer at home, you should check your Rmd file 'knits'
correctly on the online Rstudio server.

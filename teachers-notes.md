## Teachers' notes

### Course features

#### Organization and staffing

The module comprises 17 workshop sessions. Students work individually or in
pairs within workshop classes of up to 80. For each session there will be a
specified teaching assistant (Ph.D student or TARA) supporting students.

Each session is broken in half, with more intensive exercises in the first
session, followed by supported-self study or followup activities (e.g. finding
literature, working on problems).

#### Resources

All sessions in 2019/20 will be run in the a computer lab. The course requires
one computer (PC, Mac, or Linux) per student, in all sessions. Any student with
a laptop should bring it.

For activities based around R, students will use the school RStudio server.
Accounts will be released in the [first session](#beginners).

There is a need for an online **lab book** system. Students can use the Blog
system within the DLE to keep a record of their activities and progress each
week.
